# ChartGPT

ChartGPT leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Draco visualization library to automatically generate insightful and comprehensive plots from your dataframes. 
Simplify your data visualization process with intelligent automation tailored to your dataset's unique characteristics.

## Description

This is proof of consept project and just little investigation on how one could use LLMs to generate plots from dataframes.  
As well as little introduction to Draco visualization library.  
All the experiments are in `report.ipynb` notebook.  
For the sake of simplicity and development speed, I didn't bother arranging code in very professional way, distributing it in modules, etc.  
Fun fact: Unknown bird in Texas caused more than 7mln$ damage in 1998.
